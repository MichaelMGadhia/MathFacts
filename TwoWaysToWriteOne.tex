\section{Repeating Decimals}

You probably know what one third looks like as a decimal:
\[
\frac{1}{3} = 0.3333...
\]
The ``$...$'' represents infinitely many threes after the decimal point.
There are many examples of repeating decimals, and they may have more than one digit repeated.
For instance, dividing $1$ by $11$ gives $0.09090909...$ where the pattern ``$09$'' appears infinitely many times.
We sometimes use a bar to indicate repetition of a pattern, so one third is written $0.\overline{3}$ and one eleventh is written $0.\overline{09}$.

Now, consider this repeating decimal: $0.9999...$, which we can also write as $0.\overline{9}$.
When first looking at it, this number appears to be almost equal to one.
But in fact, this number is \emph{exactly} equal to one, and is just a second way of writing it!

This is a document about that fact, simple to write but often difficult to understand and believe:

\[
0.9999... = 1
\]

If the equation above seems unbelievable, or just feels wrong, don't worry.
We'll look at several ways to think about it, from simple arithmetic to a complete formal proof.

% Explaining why this is true
\section{Arguments and Proofs}

We will discuss the fact that $0.\overline{9} = 1$, and ultimately present a mathematical proof for it.
Before that, we'll look at intuitive arguments to get a sense for why it's true.

% Algebraic arguments
\subsection{Intuition}

The first way to think about it may have already occurred to you, based on the first example of a repeating decimal.
One third is $0.\overline{3}$, and multiplying this by three would look like $0.\overline{9}$, but three thirds is exactly one.
While this isn't a complete proof, this argument is often enough to convince students this is true.
There is another way to demonstrate this with grade-school algebra without relying on being given a definition of one third, which is given below.

Let $x = 0.9999...$, and consider what happens when we multiply $x$ by $10$.
Since this can be seen as `moving the decimal point' of a decimal number, we get $10x = 9.9999...$.
Now, we can subtract $x$ from both sides and get the following:
\begin{align*}
    10x - x &= 9.9999... - x\\
    9x &= 9.9999... - (0.9999...)\\
    9x &= 9
    x &= 1
\end{align*}


% Formal proofs presented with either approachable/defined terminology or warning about unfamiliarity
\subsection{Rigorous Proof}
%https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...#Rigorous_proof
This will require us to define $0.\overline{9}$ more explicitly.
We will define it in terms of an infinite sequence of numbers that approach it, $0.9$, $0.99$, and so on.
We'll name them based on the number of nines: $x_1 = 0.9$, $x_2 = 0.99$, $x_3 = 0.999$, and so on.
This creates a sequence where $x_n$ has $n$ nines after a decimal point.
We then have our definition of $0.\overline{9}$: it is the number this sequence approaches as $n$ gets larger.
The sequence will never reach this number, but every term gets closer to it, this is the \emph{limit} of the sequence.
Now, we will prove that this number that the sequence approaches is in fact equal to 1.
